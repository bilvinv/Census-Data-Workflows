# Census-Data-Workflows
This repo contains two end-to-end notebooks built on the **Census Bureau / Census Income** style dataset


- **`Classification Model.ipynb`** — supervised learning to predict **income group** (`<=50K` vs `>50K`)
- **`Segmentation.ipynb`** — unsupervised learning (K-Means) to create **personas/segments** for marketing-style analysis

Both notebooks are designed to be runnable top-to-bottom in Jupyter.
